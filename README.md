# Spa Booking Website

## Project Overview

This project is a fully functional website for a beauty spa, showcasing the treatments and services offered. The main goal is to create a visually appealing and user-friendly site that allows clients to easily explore services such as massages, facials, hair treatments, and mani-pedis, while also enabling them to schedule bookings online.

The website consists of six main pages:  
- **Homepage**: A welcoming page providing an overview of the spa and its offerings.  
- **Service Pages**: Four dedicated pages, each highlighting a specific category of services:  
  - Massages  
  - Facials  
  - Hair Treatments  
  - Mani-Pedis  
- **Booking Page**: A comprehensive page for users to schedule their desired treatments.

This project combines both front-end and back-end development to deliver an interactive and reliable booking experience.
